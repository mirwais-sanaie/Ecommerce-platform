# Authentication Debug Guide

## Issue: Dashboard redirects to login despite being authenticated

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Dashboard Page

- Added `ProtectedRoute` component wrapper
- Removed server-side middleware protection for `/dashboard`
- Added proper authentication checks

### 2. Improved Auth API

- Enhanced `/api/auth/me` route with better cookie parsing
- Added debugging logs to auth store

### 3. Updated Middleware

- Removed `/dashboard` from server-side protection
- Dashboard now uses client-side protection only

## How to Test:

1. **Create Account**: Go to `/signup` and create a new account
2. **Login**: Go to `/login` and login with your credentials
3. **Check Navbar**: You should see your email and logout button
4. **Access Dashboard**: Go to `/dashboard` - should work now

## Debug Steps if Still Not Working:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Check Network Tab**: See if `/api/auth/me` is being called and what response it returns
3. **Check Cookies**: Verify that the `token` cookie is set
4. **Check Auth Store**: The auth store should show `isAuthenticated: true`

## Expected Behavior:

- After login, navbar shows user email and logout button
- Dashboard page should load without redirecting to login
- User can access protected routes normally

## If Still Having Issues:

1. Clear browser cookies and localStorage
2. Restart the development server
3. Check the browser console for any error messages
4. Verify the JWT_SECRET is set in your environment
